      <h1>HealthKit iOS</h1>
      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p> HealthKit allows applications to connect to health and fitness data on iPhones and Apple Watches. In order to use this data, users must give permission to the app to communicate with the HealthKit store. In accessing this data, apps have the ability to read, share, or update the data stored in this central health storage system. 

This basic app will integrate with the HealthKit to read and update the userâ€™s step count. It also creates a leaderboard of users with the highest step count, but that is beyond this basic HealthKit tutorial.
